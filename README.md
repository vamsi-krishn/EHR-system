# 🏥 EHR: Secure Medical Records on Blockchain

> Patient-controlled electronic health records with secure access management and complete privacy.

## 🚀 Overview

**EHR: Secure Medical Records on Blockchain** is a decentralized platform that enables patients to control their own electronic health records (EHRs). Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this system ensures data integrity, privacy, and fine-grained access management.

Patients have full ownership of their records and can securely grant or revoke access to healthcare providers, insurance companies, or researchers as needed.
